# Migration Guide: Unified Scraper

## üéØ Overview

The two separate scrapers (`SimpleEmployeeScraper` and `CompleteScraper`) have been consolidated into a single `UnifiedEmployeeScraper` that provides comprehensive data extraction by default. No modes needed - just one complete scraper.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Single codebase** - No more duplication
- **Comprehensive data** - All features enabled by default
- **No modes** - One scraper for all use cases
- **Easier maintenance** - Changes in one place
- **Consistent behavior** - Same comprehensive logic everywhere
- **Simple interface** - Drop-in replacement

## üîÑ Migration Changes

### 1. Weekly Scraper (GitHub Actions)
**Before:**
```python
from .simple_scraper import SimpleEmployeeScraper

async with SimpleEmployeeScraper(...) as scraper:
    employees = await scraper.scrape_all_employees()
```

**After:**
```python
from .unified_scraper import UnifiedEmployeeScraper

async with UnifiedEmployeeScraper(...) as scraper:
    employees = await scraper.scrape_all_employees()
```

### 2. Main Scraper (Development)
**Before:**
```python
from .complete_scraper import CompleteScraper

scraper = CompleteScraper(config)
employees = await scraper.scrape_all_employees_incremental()
```

**After:**
```python
from .unified_scraper import UnifiedEmployeeScraper

scraper = UnifiedEmployeeScraper(config)
employees = await scraper.scrape_all_employees()
```

## üìã Features

### Comprehensive Data Extraction
- **Basic Information**: Name, email, phone, position, department, bio, office location
- **Advanced Information**: Years with firm, seat assignment, computer information
- **Professional Data**: Memberships, education, licenses, projects, recent posts
- **Contact Information**: Teams URL, LinkedIn, website, mobile phone
- **Profile Data**: Profile URL, image URL, local image path
- **Metadata**: Scraping timestamp, profile ID

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify the unified scraper works:

```bash
cd 2-scraper
python test_unified_scraper.py
```

## üìÅ Files Updated

### New Files
- `src/core/unified_scraper.py` - The unified scraper with comprehensive features
- `test_unified_scraper.py` - Test script
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - This guide

### Updated Files
- `src/core/individual_data_orchestrator.py` - Uses unified scraper
- `src/core/orchestrator.py` - Uses unified scraper
- `src/core/data_orchestrator.py` - Uses unified scraper
- `src/core/__init__.py` - Updated exports

### Removed Files
- `src/core/simple_scraper.py` - Deleted (replaced by unified scraper)
- `src/core/complete_scraper.py` - Deleted (replaced by unified scraper)
- `src/core/base_scraper.py` - Deleted (functionality merged into unified scraper)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the unified scraper** with comprehensive features
2. **Verify data extraction** includes all expected fields
3. **Monitor performance** in both GitHub Actions and local development
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the new architecture

## üîç Verification

To ensure the migration was successful:

1. **Weekly scraper** should work with comprehensive data extraction
2. **Main scraper** should work with comprehensive data extraction
3. **Enhanced data** - more fields extracted than before
4. **Same performance** - no regression in speed
5. **Same reliability** - no new bugs introduced

The unified scraper provides comprehensive data extraction while eliminating code duplication!
