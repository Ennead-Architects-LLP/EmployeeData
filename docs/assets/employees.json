My journey in the U.S. began when I moved to Baltimore, MD, where I would spend most of my time as a young adult gaining a different perspective on history and culture, as well as architecture and design. I was fortunate enough to attend Howard University in Washington, DC where I received a Bachelor's degree in Architecture. After spending some years developing my skills, I found my way to New York City intrigued by the idea of exploring architectural solutions that address both current and future issues urban environments will face at a local and global scale. When I’m not immersing myself in design, I spend most of my time attending, hosting and planning whisky events through my company @WhiskyArch. I’m constantly looking to learn new things and share my experiences, so feel free to reach out anytime. Cheers!

In 2005 I moved to NYC and worked for Carlos Zapata Studio (formerly Wood + Zapata) and a+i. In 2011 I went to Yale for an M.Arch II degree.

    "bio": "I was born in New Orleans and pretty much grew up on a construction site.  My house was always being renovated, mostly by my father, grandfather, and myself - wielding a hammer at a young age.   When we weren't working on our own house, we would walk through any job site in the neighborhood that we could sneak in to, trying to decipher what they were doing with the design, how they were constructing it, and if there was something we could learn.  I imagine I've probably walked through over 100 houses that were framed up that I had absolutely nothing to do with. It was an easy decision for me to go to architecture school.  I went to UVa for undergrad with a very hands-on architecture program.  I then followed a UVa professor back to New Orleans, when he became dean of Tulane, for grad school. I've lived in Houston, Dallas, and Shangahai, but finally moved to NYC in 2016 and started at Ennead when my wife matched to Mt. Sinai for residency.   Ironically, I've been working on Mt. Sinai's Downtown hospital for about as long as I've been here. I love living in NYC, but its difficult to get out and play golf and get into the wood shop, which are my main hobbies outside of sneaking onto residential construction sites (which is not something I've tried since moving here!)",

    "bio": "I’m a proud member of Ennead’s club of Midwest expatriates, having grown up in Champaign, Illinois. I came to New York City for college more than thirty years ago, and with short stints in Boston (to attend the GSD), Lesotho, and Rome, I have been here ever since. I live in Park Slope with my wife and two teenagers.I started at Ennead (I think!) on January 2, 2000, after working in a smaller office doing residential and commercial work. One of my first projects was the Brooklyn Museum entrance and plaza, which I suspect will remain a once-in-a-career opportunity to make that kind of contribution to my own community. Having apprenticed for ten years on the NYU Langone Campus Transformation, I now lead the Healthcare Center. I enjoy these jobs for their complexity and the strategic planning they involve and because healthcare is an area where better design can have a huge impact.",

I went to UCLA for my Master Degree of Architecture in 2013, from my 25 to 30, I had a great 5-year journey in Los Angeles and visited most of the big cities in United States. Therefore I feel strong connection with this country. in 2018 I relocated in Shanghai and joined Ennead, it has been a while since then but I still feel lucky and excited about this fresh start.I grew up in an art academy where my dad teaches. I got chance to touch different art forms like fashion, sculpture, and painting as a kid. I was charmed by architecture most because of the logical thinking, perfect balance between emotion and techniques.I believe that is what we are working together to achieve in Ennead, something fun, delicate and andvaced.As a normal guy I enjoy traveling, movies and live concert just like everyone. My biggest interest in my spare time is in fighting training. I was training in Krav Maga in LA for 1.5 years and I am now doing Muay Thai and BJJ. Training makes me stronger both physically and mentally, I recommend everyone could give a try.Let's build something interesting together.",

    "bio": "I was born and raised in NYC, a child of academic parents, attending Columbia University three times – pre-K, college and graduate school.  Summers in Maine gave me an education in the value of small communities based on individualism, interdependency and service - much like our office!  In Maine I learned to build houses, repair wooden boats, fight fires, and earned a commercial boat captain’s license (which I still have).My first architecture job was here at Ennead (then Polshek) when I was in charge of ordering supplies and running prints.  After graduate school and a short stint at a now-defunct firm called Proposition: Architecture, I returned to this office and sampled pretty much every role: junior designer, job captain, project architect, project manager, etc.  Along the way I led the implementation first of CAD and later BIM.  My 30+ years here continue to give me boundless satisfaction – because of the people I get to work with and because the architecture and research the firm produces makes a difference in the world.When I have free time I like to spend it renovating our house, shooting photos and visiting strange new places.",

After 14 years in France  I decided to move back to the US for college and somehow ended up in Houston, Texas at Rice University.After four years at Rice, I came to Ennead to intern for 9 months and ended up staying two years! After a whirlwind 5th year of studying in Paris and Houston and (finally) graduating, I couldn't stand being away from Ennead any longer. Outside the office, I love to cook (the spicier the better), drink tea (pretty much only earl grey) and explore.",

    "bio": "I am originally from Virginia—born and grew up in Richmond and later attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The son of a school teacher and a contractor, I suppose that learning and building are in my blood. I came to New York in the early 90s for graduate school at Columbia—at the time I had no idea that I would stay here, but New York has a way of growing on you. I have spent almost my entire professional career at Ennead, having started working at Polshek right out of grad school. I have had the great pleasure of working with some incredibly talented architects on some amazing projects...science museums, colleges/universities, and New York City municipal buildings. I was initially attracted to the firm because of its excellence across all facets of the profession—design, management and technical execution—and continue to believe that this is our unique strength.In my spare time, I am a naturalist, birdwatcher, hiker, gardener, woodworker, sawyer, painter, handyman, tool restorer, dog and cat lover, photographer... Clearly too many hobbies for so little free time!",

    "bio": "I'm a native Michigander (no bird jokes please), raised in the Detroit area, completing my undergraduate work at the University of Michigan's School of Business Administration.  After working for several years as a CPA for Arthur Andersen & Co., I concluded that financial security was an unseemly goal and left for New York City to become an architect. Graduating from Columbia University in 1984, I joined James Stewart Polshek and Partners and have been with Polshek/Ennead ever since.I serve as Technical Director of the firm and, as such, have been tasked with leading the effort in developing the office's technical resources and maintaining the quality of our work. Over my 35 years in the office, I've seen a lot and retained enough of it to be knowledgeable about much of what doesn't work and some of what does. Although my sporting days are rapidly fading from memory, I remain an avid, if more sedentary outdoorsman, engaged in gardening and photography mixed in with the occasional  hiking or kayaking expedition in the mistaken belief that I will recapture my youth.",

    "bio": "I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. After spending a year in Georgia as a high school exchange student, I returned home and graduated from foreign language high school where I majored in French; sadly, my French skill got rusted and I’d like to work on it again.  Then, I came back to the States for the college. I went to Pratt Institute for a B.Arch with construction management as a minor. Immediately after Pratt, I went to GSAPP at Columbia University for a MS. in advanced architectural design.I give credit to (or blame on) my sister for unintentionally brainwashing me into studying architecture as she always talked about it. She is still a great influence, sharing architectural news and translating the Japanese architecture magazines/books for me. Oh, she became a cool Japanese-to-Korean translator instead of an architect. Before joining Ennead, I’ve worked on the public schools and affordable housing restoration/rehabilitation, and a new ground-up community center in public interest design. My experience at architecture firms also includes the healthcare facilities, high-end residential condominiums and residential renovation.Outside of the office, I’m a traveler. I love traveling, trying different foods, learning new languages, and exploring the cultures. My favorite experience so far was lying down on Sahara Desert in Morocco and staring at the millions of stars all night.",

I spent a short time in Philadelphia after graduating before moving to New York to work as a exterior wall consultant at R.A. Heintges (Heintges and Associates).  Here I began focusing on exterior envelope detailing which continues to be my passion. I joined Ennead (Polshek Partership) in 2001 and have been working on the exterior of exciting projects ever since.Outside of work I enjoy hiking all year round, kayaking (just got a kayak!) and volunteering at the local animal shelter.",

    "bio": "I was raised in a small suburban town in northern Connecticut before moving on to Boston for undergraduate school. Afterward, I worked a few years for various architecture firms before attending graduate school in upstate New York. With my school days behind me, I came to the city and worked for Gran Associates where I managed their high school restructuring and renovation projects. In 2008, I joined Ennead Architects and began working on the Sinatra School, followed by the Yale Art Gallery renovation and the Kimmel Pavilion Hospital.I am particularly interested in saving the planet through environmentally responsive design and high performance healthcare buildings :-)Outside of work, I enjoy cycling and exploring the city with my son.",

I got my undergraduate architecture degree from the University of Texas at Austin and my masters degree in historic preservation from Columbia University.  I've taught at the New York Institute of Technology and served as the president of Preservation Alumni.Before joining Ennead in 2011, I worked at Gensler (both the San Francisco and New York offices) and was an associate at a small preservation-focused firm, Jan Hird Pokorny Associates.  At Ennead, I have worked on the Cincinnati Music Hall; the Cathedral School renovations and expansion; multiple projects for the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, such as the North Transept; the Northwell 75 project; and NYU's renovation of 25 West 4th Street.I'm a member of the AIA's Historic Building Committee and the Association of Preservation Technology.",

    "bio": "I am from a small town outside of Memphis, TN in Desoto County, Mississippi.  I currently live in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn with my husband and daughter. I had an unconventional path to architecture and started my education in DC studying business administration, marketing, and sociology. While living in DC and working in an assistant buyer program, I started taking classes in the evening at a local community college. This eventually led me to an MFA program at GWU in Interior Architecture and Design. After working for several firms and the Overseas Buildings Operations, I left DC to further my education in Philadelphia at PennDesign. After completing my degree, I pivoted to teaching and have been a visiting professor at Pratt Institute since 2009. I have continued to balance a teaching while practicing - which became trickier when I had my daughter.  I was ultimately able to figure it out.  The completed project that I am most proud of is my work at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture Slavery gallery. In recent years, the wheel has come full circle. I have been able to blend my business background foundation with my passion for architecture and design.",

My family owned a restaurant in Flint, Michigan for 30 years and I spent my first two years of college working with and getting to know the Flint community during the water crisis, which is still ongoing. I then attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where I received my BFA in Graphic Design with interests in environmental studies. I have a lot of personal and professional interest in the topics of sustainability, community, and gender/cultural identity.In my free time, I like reading, live music, people watching, knick knacks of any kind and drafting up my own designs on my sewing machine. Food is an important part of my life, and I will always happily accept restaurant recommendations!",

Prior to joining Ennead, I worked in the art world, in art galleries and arts communications firms. My interests encompass the intersection of visual culture and storytelling, and how innovative storytelling modalities can engage the public in the history of art and architecture. In my free time, I design and conduct accessible, storytelling-based museum tours!Outside of my professional interests, I love Pilates, museums, theater, pop culture, travel, and fashion history!

After attending the University of Texas at Austin, and a short time studying abroad in Tuscany, I moved to San Francisco where I enjoyed designing wineries, schools and multi-family residences. In 2012, I moved east and joined Ennead Architects. During my time at Ennead, I have worked on a wide range of projects including performance spaces, retail spaces and academic projects. Recently, I have taken on the role of Project Manager on a number projects with a focus on K-12 projects.  I am also involved in organizing essential resources and knowledge management for the office. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering, sewing, exploring the outdoors and chasing around my young daughter.",

I took that same interest to Hillier / RMJM, where I lead the Design in New York. When coming to Ennead, I was particularly enthused about bringing my interest in intersecting the institutional, cultural and educational into a more global practice for Ennead. I am particularly interested in the urban experience, how the commercial intersects with education and culture, and how aesthetic and urbanistic goals can mutually reinforce one another. I’m thrilled to be here.",

    "bio": "I was born and raised near Princeton, NJ. As an undergraduate, I attended Cornell University and participated in a summer program at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. Upon graduating college, I was the 9th employee of James Stewart Polshek Architects, starting in November 1979 -- a few weeks after Todd, who was the 8th.  Since then, my work has encompassed projects as diverse as the headquarters for a public broadcasting station, a wastewater treatment plant, museums, performing arts centers, and a presidential library. I am particularly interested in the integration of new architecture with the historic urban fabric and served as a Commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission for 11 years. I was a recipient of the American Academy in Rome’s Founders Rome Prize Fellowship for 2003-04 and recently a Favrot Visiting Professor at Tulane University.Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two daughters, ages 21 and 24. My interests: firearms and daytime television.",

    "bio": "Originally from New Jersey, as an undergrad I attended the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where I received my BFA in Architecture. Following this, I spent about 5 years working in NYC. First two at Midtown Preservation, a historic preservation & restoration firm, where I performed façade and roof inspections and managed projects on-site. The next three were at Building Studio Architects, a small office in midtown, where I worked on a range of projects including  a number of synagogues in South Brooklyn. If you have a project that is going to need a mikvah, come talk to me first! (or your rabbi)I recently graduated with my Master of Architecture from the University of Virginia. While there, I edited the school's design journal LUNCH, designed and fabricated an installation for the Smithsonian museum, spent a summer abroad in China, and chaired the graduate student government. My studio work was featured on the local news in Virginia, following which people said mean things about me on the internet. Such is life these days.With the little free time I have, I like to focus on music and comedy. I used to help run a small noise music label in Amherst, every release of which was utterly unlistenable, and have performed improv comedy in New York and Chicago. I have strong opinions about why architects should take comedy classes, which I am happy to discuss at length.",

After graduating I moved back to New York to work at Ennead. I have spent most of my time here working on OBO projects with the occasional excursion into other project types. My extracurriculars have included supporting the office's ei platform, CA Forum, and navigator resources.I danced ballet growing up, and one of my favorite things to do now is go to dance performances. (I once heard someone describe both dance and architecture as the two arts of movement through space.) Other favorite pastimes include hiking, staring wistfully at other people's dogs in dog parks, cooking when I have the time, and very slowly building up my crocheting repertoire.",

After graduating, I worked on a range of projects in NYC including multi-family supportive housing, mixed-use, open spaces, and a full-service animal shelter.Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, cooking and exploring new places. Last fall I was able to fulfill a longtime dream to travel extensively around Southeast Asia and experience each country’s unique cuisine!",

    "bio": "Born and raised in Michigan and the product of twelve years of Catholic school, I am hopelessly guilt-ridden and forever at your service. Once upon a time, I used to play the piano tirelessly but only get an occasional crack at the ivories now, because I am usually either at the office, commuting back and forth from the office (the Shanghai office included) or pretending to be a farmer on our 200+year old, 7 acre homestead in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. Yes, I ride a 1952 Farmall Cub tractor and know how to operate a backhoe, and spend the rest of my time drawing pictures on trace or cooking with the family. One day, I dream to move back to NYC.",

    "bio": "I was born on the island of Manhattan in 1965 and brought home to a dilapidated single-family townhouse in a bad neighborhood that today is the mall called SoHo.  My mother became a founding teacher at a weird and experimental school in Brooklyn called St Ann’s, and there I went for grades 1 through 12.  No grades.  No tests.  Lots of art.  Growing up in the city was a trip that offered me crazy experiences, like at 11 being in the paid professional chorus of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and at 15 a job (with Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys) renting people rowboats in Central Park.  From NYC I went to Dartmouth, studied Art History, spent a third of my time in Italy, and learned for the first-time what nature was all about.  After a year or two off (working as a paralegal), I then went to Harvard for my architectural education, where on summers off I wrote guide books on Italy for the Let’s Go series.  Upon graduation, I worked for Bill Rawn, then got picked up by Arata Isozaki to work in his yet to open NYC office.  Though I moved back to NYC to work for him, he couldn’t yet employ me, and asked that I “temp” until the office opened.  Two years of temping later, impatient and angry with Isozaki, I walked into the office of the Managing Partner of the firm where I was then temping and demanded a job.  That firm was Polshek and Partners (not fair: I knew Jim Polshek since I was a little boy).Like most designers, I am interested in form, proportion, materiality and the sublime potential of architecture, but my passion is to harness the power of well-designed environments to influence human interactivity and strengthen communities.  I consider buildings as cultural change agents that should—as architecture’s highest calling—positively impact human emotional, social, and intellectual well-being.  I have worked almost exclusively with not-for-profit institutional clients, and so enjoy collaborating with my teams to deliver buildings that advance interdisciplinary exchange, intellectual inquiry, and innovation to allow institutions to more effectively deliver on the promise of their missions.  Today I am also highly engaged in the debate about the future of design as a practice—and I fear for our profession as it enters what I think will be its crazy age of disruption and existential crisis.I have been very involved in the project of the city and the preservation of the arts.  My interests have led me to stints as the President of the Fine Arts Federation of New York, as a founding board member for Design on Screen (makes documentary films on the unsung heroes of design and architecture), as the Chairman of the Board of the Jose Limon Dance Foundation, an advisory board member to the Design Colloquium, and the President of AIANY.  Now I am happily done with all boards.  I am really into cycling, cooking, drinking good wine, and traveling (not for work).  I am separated from my wife but she remains my best friend (its like a Gwyneth Paltrow thing), and we lovingly co-parent my three boys, two cats, and one bird.I love our design culture, and I am amazed at the ingenious and creative people I get to work with every day.",

While there I got really into film making, mostly strange art films and animations, I also did architecture. Prior to Ennead, I worked in Buffalo, NY; volunteered in Port-au-Price, Haiti; competition-milled and lived the good life in Rome, Italy.While at Ennead, I have had the pleasure of working on a wide range of projects including a hospital pavilion, a neuro-science laboratory, a retail shop for the wealthiest corporation in the history of civilization, a very metropolitan performing arts venue and many, many competition pursuits and proposals.Recently, I have taken on the role of Project Designer which has been incredibly challenging and professionally rewarding in equal measure.Outside the office I enjoy cycling, all aquatic-related activities, classic cinema and attempting new recipes where I try and dirty every dish in the house.",
