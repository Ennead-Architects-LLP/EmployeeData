  "bio": "Born and raised in Michigan and the product of twelve years of Catholic school, I am hopelessly guilt-ridden and forever at your service. Once upon a time, I used to play the piano tirelessly but only get an occasional crack at the ivories now, because I am usually either at the office, commuting back and forth from the office (the Shanghai office included) or pretending to be a farmer on our 200+year old, 7 acre homestead in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. Yes, I ride a 1952 Farmall Cub tractor and know how to operate a backhoe, and spend the rest of my time drawing pictures on trace or cooking with the family. One day, I dream to move back to NYC.",
