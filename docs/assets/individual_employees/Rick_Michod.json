  "bio": "I grew up in Chicago, sojourned in San Francisco selling hot dogs in union square and painting, before I ended up back in Chicago working for an Architect.  What came next was Los Angeles and Sci-Arc.  A project called HL23 with Neil Denari Architects brought me to NY where I stayed, got married, inheriting a Long-hair Chihuahua named Cheese and after 12 years of tlc, I still can't spell Chihuahua.  After a brief soiree into the world of Developer and Contracting, I joined Ennead.  It's been a pleasure working, learning and laughing with you guys!
