  "bio": "After graduating from Washington University, I started my architecture career at a small firm in St. Louis where I worked on mainly multi-unit residential projects. Graduate study at the University of Virginia landed me in Charlottesville for three years then my job at Ennead brought me to NYC. Shortly before the pandemic I moved from Hell's Kitchen to my home state of New Jersey, and I currently reside in Jersey City with my husband and son. In our spare time you'll find us at a Red Bulls or Gotham FC soccer game or grilling in our backyard.",
