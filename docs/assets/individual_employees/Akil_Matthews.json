  "bio": "I am originally from the twin island of Trinidad and Tobago, a place in the Caribbean known for having a vibrant and diverse culture of music, food and people. My journey in the U.S. began when I moved to Baltimore, MD, where I would spend most of my time as a young adult gaining a different perspective on history and culture, as well as architecture and design. I was fortunate enough to attend Howard University in Washington, DC where I received a Bachelor's degree in Architecture. After spending some years developing my skills, I found my way to New York City intrigued by the idea of exploring architectural solutions that address both current and future issues urban environments will face at a local and global scale. When I’m not immersing myself in design, I spend most of my time attending, hosting and planning whisky events through my company @WhiskyArch. I’m constantly looking to learn new things and share my experiences, so feel free to reach out anytime. Cheers!",
