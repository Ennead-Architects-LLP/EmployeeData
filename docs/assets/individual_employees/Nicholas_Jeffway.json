  "bio": "Stories lie hidden in the textures, forms and spaces which surround us. The subtleties and nuances of these narratives reveal where we have been and where we are headed. Originally from Northampton, Massachusetts; I grew up as one of five children (one of which being my twin sister) with a father who is an electronic engineer and toy inventor and a mother who is a French teacher. I have always been interested in different modes of working creatively. I began my undergraduate studies as a graphic designer, but eventually transferred to the architecture program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.I have worked as a fabricator for a small studio making sculpture, furniture and architectural elements. I have worked with the National Trust for Historic Presentation to organize and lead a community-driven design for a memorial park proposal in Richmond, VA. I have designed and built a tea house during the course of a month with a budget of sixty dollars, and I continue to use my interest in photography as an excuse to travel, explore and meet new people.I see architecture as a common ground between disparate voices and as a challenge to create a more holistic and harmonious future.",
