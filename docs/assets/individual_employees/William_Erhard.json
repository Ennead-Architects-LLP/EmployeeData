  "bio": "I’m a native Cape Codder. Cotuit, MA – basically the ‘bicep’ of the Cape.I received my B.Arch at Cornell in Ithaca, NY – closest ocean: 8 hours.  While there I got really into film making, mostly strange art films and animations, I also did architecture. Prior to Ennead, I worked in Buffalo, NY; volunteered in Port-au-Price, Haiti; competition-milled and lived the good life in Rome, Italy.While at Ennead, I have had the pleasure of working on a wide range of projects including a hospital pavilion, a neuro-science laboratory, a retail shop for the wealthiest corporation in the history of civilization, a very metropolitan performing arts venue and many, many competition pursuits and proposals.Recently, I have taken on the role of Project Designer which has been incredibly challenging and professionally rewarding in equal measure.Outside the office I enjoy cycling, all aquatic-related activities, classic cinema and attempting new recipes where I try and dirty every dish in the house.",
