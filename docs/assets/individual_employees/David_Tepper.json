  "bio": "I’m a proud member of Ennead’s club of Midwest expatriates, having grown up in Champaign, Illinois. I came to New York City for college more than thirty years ago, and with short stints in Boston (to attend the GSD), Lesotho, and Rome, I have been here ever since. I live in Park Slope with my wife and two teenagers.I started at Ennead (I think!) on January 2, 2000, after working in a smaller office doing residential and commercial work. One of my first projects was the Brooklyn Museum entrance and plaza, which I suspect will remain a once-in-a-career opportunity to make that kind of contribution to my own community. Having apprenticed for ten years on the NYU Langone Campus Transformation, I now lead the Healthcare Center. I enjoy these jobs for their complexity and the strategic planning they involve and because healthcare is an area where better design can have a huge impact.
