  "bio": "I have a history and a past prior to Ennead. I was at KPF for twenty years. As design principal there, my focus was on institutional as well as commercial buildings. I took that same interest to Hillier / RMJM, where I lead the Design in New York. When coming to Ennead, I was particularly enthused about bringing my interest in intersecting the institutional, cultural and educational into a more global practice for Ennead. I am particularly interested in the urban experience, how the commercial intersects with education and culture, and how aesthetic and urbanistic goals can mutually reinforce one another. Iâ€™m thrilled to be here.",
