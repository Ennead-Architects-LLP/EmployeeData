  "bio": "I grew up in Oklahoma, the daughter of an episcopal priest, a banker, an electrical engineer and a creative digital asset manager. I went to Oklahoma State University  for a B.Arch where I learned that water runs down hill, *stuff stinks, stone is heavy, and composition matters.  In 2005 I moved to NYC and worked for Carlos Zapata Studio (formerly Wood + Zapata) and a+i. In 2011 I went to Yale for an M.Arch II degree. I learned that positioning a project is everything, active form is underrepresented, and form generated from material is by far the most interesting object form.",
