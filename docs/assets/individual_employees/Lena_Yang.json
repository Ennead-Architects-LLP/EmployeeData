  "bio": "I grew up in Grand Blanc, Michigan, a small suburban town. My family owned a restaurant in Flint, Michigan for 30 years and I spent my first two years of college working with and getting to know the Flint community during the water crisis, which is still ongoing. I then attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where I received my BFA in Graphic Design with interests in environmental studies. I have a lot of personal and professional interest in the topics of sustainability, community, and gender/cultural identity.In my free time, I like reading, live music, people watching, knick knacks of any kind and drafting up my own designs on my sewing machine. Food is an important part of my life, and I will always happily accept restaurant recommendations! I grew up in Grand Blanc, Michigan, a small suburban town.
