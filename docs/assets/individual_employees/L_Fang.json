I became a Canadian 5 years ago. Currently, I am living in Brooklyn and studying architecture at Pratt Institute Undergrad. I have two cats in Canada, and I plan to have more. In my free time, I enjoy photography and making random fidget and paper goods. I am also known as Qirui Fang, which is my given name.
