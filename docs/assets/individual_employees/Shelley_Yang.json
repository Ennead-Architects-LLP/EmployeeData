  "bio": "I was born in Taiwan and grew up in Queens, NY. I lived in the windy city while studying psychology at the University of Chicago but decided to switch gears from conducting studies in a lab to creating study models at the Spitzer School of Architecture. After graduating, I worked on a range of projects in NYC including multi-family supportive housing, mixed-use, open spaces, and a full-service animal shelter.Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, cooking and exploring new places. Last fall I was able to fulfill a longtime dream to travel extensively around Southeast Asia and experience each countryâ€™s unique cuisine!",
