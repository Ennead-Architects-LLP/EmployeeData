  "bio": "I was born on the island of Manhattan in 1965 and brought home to a dilapidated single-family townhouse in a bad neighborhood that today is the mall called SoHo.  My mother became a founding teacher at a weird and experimental school in Brooklyn called St Ann’s, and there I went for grades 1 through 12.  No grades.  No tests.  Lots of art.  Growing up in the city was a trip that offered me crazy experiences, like at 11 being in the paid professional chorus of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and at 15 a job (with Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys) renting people rowboats in Central Park.  From NYC I went to Dartmouth, studied Art History, spent a third of my time in Italy, and learned for the first-time what nature was all about.  After a year or two off (working as a paralegal), I then went to Harvard for my architectural education, where on summers off I wrote guide books on Italy for the Let’s Go series.  Upon graduation, I worked for Bill Rawn, then got picked up by Arata Isozaki to work in his yet to open NYC office.  Though I moved back to NYC to work for him, he couldn’t yet employ me, and asked that I “temp” until the office opened.  Two years of temping later, impatient and angry with Isozaki, I walked into the office of the Managing Partner of the firm where I was then temping and demanded a job.  That firm was Polshek and Partners (not fair: I knew Jim Polshek since I was a little boy).Like most designers, I am interested in form, proportion, materiality and the sublime potential of architecture, but my passion is to harness the power of well-designed environments to influence human interactivity and strengthen communities.  I consider buildings as cultural change agents that should—as architecture’s highest calling—positively impact human emotional, social, and intellectual well-being.  I have worked almost exclusively with not-for-profit institutional clients, and so enjoy collaborating with my teams to deliver buildings that advance interdisciplinary exchange, intellectual inquiry, and innovation to allow institutions to more effectively deliver on the promise of their missions.  Today I am also highly engaged in the debate about the future of design as a practice—and I fear for our profession as it enters what I think will be its crazy age of disruption and existential crisis.I have been very involved in the project of the city and the preservation of the arts.  My interests have led me to stints as the President of the Fine Arts Federation of New York, as a founding board member for Design on Screen (makes documentary films on the unsung heroes of design and architecture), as the Chairman of the Board of the Jose Limon Dance Foundation, an advisory board member to the Design Colloquium, and the President of AIANY.  Now I am happily done with all boards.  I am really into cycling, cooking, drinking good wine, and traveling (not for work).  I am separated from my wife but she remains my best friend (its like a Gwyneth Paltrow thing), and we lovingly co-parent my three boys, two cats, and one bird.I love our design culture, and I am amazed at the ingenious and creative people I get to work with every day.
