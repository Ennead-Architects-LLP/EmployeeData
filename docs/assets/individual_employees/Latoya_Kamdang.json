  "bio": "I am from a small town outside of Memphis, TN in Desoto County, Mississippi.  I currently live in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn with my husband and daughter. I had an unconventional path to architecture and started my education in DC studying business administration, marketing, and sociology. While living in DC and working in an assistant buyer program, I started taking classes in the evening at a local community college. This eventually led me to an MFA program at GWU in Interior Architecture and Design. After working for several firms and the Overseas Buildings Operations, I left DC to further my education in Philadelphia at PennDesign. After completing my degree, I pivoted to teaching and have been a visiting professor at Pratt Institute since 2009. I have continued to balance a teaching while practicing - which became trickier when I had my daughter.  I was ultimately able to figure it out.  The completed project that I am most proud of is my work at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture Slavery gallery. In recent years, the wheel has come full circle. I have been able to blend my business background foundation with my passion for architecture and design. I am from a small town outside of Memphis, TN in Desoto County, Mississippi.
