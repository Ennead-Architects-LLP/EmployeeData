  "bio": "I was born and raised near Princeton, NJ. As an undergraduate, I attended Cornell University and participated in a summer program at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. Upon graduating college, I was the 9th employee of James Stewart Polshek Architects, starting in November 1979 -- a few weeks after Todd, who was the 8th.  Since then, my work has encompassed projects as diverse as the headquarters for a public broadcasting station, a wastewater treatment plant, museums, performing arts centers, and a presidential library. I am particularly interested in the integration of new architecture with the historic urban fabric and served as a Commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission for 11 years. I was a recipient of the American Academy in Rome’s Founders Rome Prize Fellowship for 2003-04 and recently a Favrot Visiting Professor at Tulane University.Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two daughters, ages 21 and 24. My interests: firearms and daytime television. I was born and raised near Princeton, NJ.
