  "bio": "I was raised in a small suburban town in northern Connecticut before moving on to Boston for undergraduate school. Afterward, I worked a few years for various architecture firms before attending graduate school in upstate New York. With my school days behind me, I came to the city and worked for Gran Associates where I managed their high school restructuring and renovation projects. In 2008, I joined Ennead Architects and began working on the Sinatra School, followed by the Yale Art Gallery renovation and the Kimmel Pavilion Hospital.I am particularly interested in saving the planet through environmentally responsive design and high performance healthcare buildings :-)Outside of work, I enjoy cycling and exploring the city with my son.",
