  "bio": "Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina but grew up in Orlando, Florida. I come from a performing arts background, so I love to sing, play the guitar, and occasionally do some acting. I am a huge theater and concertgoer, basically any type of live entertainment. I got a Bachelor of Design with a Major in Architecture from the University of Florida, and a minor in Landscape Design. Most recently got my Master of Architecture degree from Carnegie Mellon University, with a specific focus on Theater Design. Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina but grew up in Orlando, Florida.
