  "bio": "I was born and raised in central Connecticut and went to undergraduate school in Boston and graduate school in upstate New York. I spent a short time in Philadelphia after graduating before moving to New York to work as a exterior wall consultant at R.A. Heintges (Heintges and Associates).  Here I began focusing on exterior envelope detailing which continues to be my passion. I joined Ennead (Polshek Partership) in 2001 and have been working on the exterior of exciting projects ever since.Outside of work I enjoy hiking all year round, kayaking (just got a kayak!) and volunteering at the local animal shelter.
