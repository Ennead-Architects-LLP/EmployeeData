  "bio": "I was born and raised in NYC, a child of academic parents, attending Columbia University three times – pre-K, college and graduate school.  Summers in Maine gave me an education in the value of small communities based on individualism, interdependency and service - much like our office!  In Maine I learned to build houses, repair wooden boats, fight fires, and earned a commercial boat captain’s license (which I still have).My first architecture job was here at Ennead (then Polshek) when I was in charge of ordering supplies and running prints.  After graduate school and a short stint at a now-defunct firm called Proposition: Architecture, I returned to this office and sampled pretty much every role: junior designer, job captain, project architect, project manager, etc.  Along the way I led the implementation first of CAD and later BIM.  My 30+ years here continue to give me boundless satisfaction – because of the people I get to work with and because the architecture and research the firm produces makes a difference in the world.When I have free time I like to spend it renovating our house, shooting photos and visiting strange new places.
