  "bio": "I grew up in Yuma, Arizona and graduated from The University of Arizona with a Bachelor of Architecture degree. I began my career working for a small firm, The Architecture Company (TAC), where I was given the responsibilities of completing State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) forms and documentation, marketing, project archiving, and construction administration. I moved to New York City and joined Ennead Architects in the fall of 2013 where I continue to focus on construction administration and have been part of various projects including a higher education facility, an academic laboratory, a teaching and research healthcare center, and an Embassy. I became a member Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) in 2018. I hold a professional certification in Construction Documents Technologist (CDT) from CSI and am working toward becoming a Certified Construction Contract Administrator (CCCA).
