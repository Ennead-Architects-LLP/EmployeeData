  "bio": "I am originally from Virginia—born and grew up in Richmond and later attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. The son of a school teacher and a contractor, I suppose that learning and building are in my blood. I came to New York in the early 90s for graduate school at Columbia—at the time I had no idea that I would stay here, but New York has a way of growing on you. I have spent almost my entire professional career at Ennead, having started working at Polshek right out of grad school. I have had the great pleasure of working with some incredibly talented architects on some amazing projects...science museums, colleges/universities, and New York City municipal buildings. I was initially attracted to the firm because of its excellence across all facets of the profession—design, management and technical execution—and continue to believe that this is our unique strength.In my spare time, I am a naturalist, birdwatcher, hiker, gardener, woodworker, sawyer, painter, handyman, tool restorer, dog and cat lover, photographer... Clearly too many hobbies for so little free time! I am originally from Virginia—born and grew up in Richmond and later attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
