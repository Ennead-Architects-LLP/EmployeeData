  "bio": "I grew up in Charleston, WV and never want to hear the song \"Country Roads\" again.While at the University of Chicago, I studied everything from bioarchaeology to organic chemistry before finally settling on public policy. My senior thesis was about political advocacy and citizenship in the Pan Asian American community of the Greater Chicago area. I went straight to PennDesign for my MArch where I mastered NetworkSrf, studied big dumb objects, and played with a lot of color and robots. After graduating, I returned to Penn to TA for Simon Kim and Florencia Pita's advanced studios.I co-started the EnneaD&D club and am always happy to talk gaming in general. New players welcome!",
