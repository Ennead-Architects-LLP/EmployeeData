  "bio": "I am a born and raised Houstonian. After attending the University of Texas at Austin, and a short time studying abroad in Tuscany, I moved to San Francisco where I enjoyed designing wineries, schools and multi-family residences. In 2012, I moved east and joined Ennead Architects. During my time at Ennead, I have worked on a wide range of projects including performance spaces, retail spaces and academic projects. Recently, I have taken on the role of Project Manager on a number projects with a focus on K-12 projects.  I am also involved in organizing essential resources and knowledge management for the office. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering, sewing, exploring the outdoors and chasing around my young daughter.
