  "bio": "Howdy! I hail from the Lone Star State, and now reside in Brooklyn.  I made a pit stop at Syracuse University where I received my Bachelor's of Architecture in 2014.  I've since worked in multi-family residential firms like Whitehall Interiors/Hill West Architects, and later transitioned to civic and institutional at Beyer Blinder Belle Architects and Planners.  I'm a dutiful cat & plant mom; catch me on my off time listening to disco and roller skating.",
